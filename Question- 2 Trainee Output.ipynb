    "### Selection of MPCS exams include a fitness test which is conducted on ground. There will be a batch of 3 trainees, appearing for running test in track for 3 rounds. You need to record their oxygen level after every round. After trainee are finished with all rounds, calculate for each trainee his average oxygen level over the 3 rounds and select one with highest oxygen level as the most fit trainee. If more than one trainee attains the same highest average level, they all need to be selected.\n",
